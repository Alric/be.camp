### Reporting Bugs

This section guides you through submitting a bug report for be.camp. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your report :pencil:, reproduce the behavior :computer: :computer:, and find related reports :mag_right:.

Before creating bug reports, please check [this list](#before-submitting-a-bug-report) as you might find out that you don't need to create one. When you are creating a bug report, please [include as many details as possible](#how-do-i-submit-a-good-bug-report). Fill out [the required template](ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md), the information it asks for helps maintainers resolve issues faster.

> **Note:** If you find a **Closed** issue that seems like it is the same thing that you're experiencing, open a new issue and include a link to the original issue in the body of your new one.

#### Before Submitting A Bug Report

* Most importantly, ensure that you can reproduce the problem.
* **Perform a [cursory search](https://github.com/wearebraid/be.camp/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen)** to see if the problem has already been reported. If it has **and the issue is still open**, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.

#### How Do I Submit A (Good) Bug Report?

Bugs are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://github.com/wearebraid/be.camp/issues).

Explain the problem and include additional details to help maintainers reproduce the problem:

* **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the problem.
* **Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem** in as many details as possible. For example, start by explaining how you arrived on the page that exhibits the issue (fresh load vs secondary page load). When listing steps, **don't just say what you did, but explain how you did it**. For example, if you "went to the about page" did you get there from the primary navigation, or a footer link, or some in-page content?
* **Explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.**
* **Include screenshots** when possible that clearly demonstrate the problem.
* **Include any console errors** that appear in your browser's dev tools.
* **If the problem wasn't triggered by a specific action**, describe what you were doing before the problem happened and share more information using the guidelines below.

Provide more context by answering these questions:

* **Can you reproduce the problem with a consistent series of steps?** If not, provide details about how often the problem happens and under which conditions it normally happens.
* **Did the problem start happening recently** or has this always been a problem?

Include details about your configuration and environment:

* **What browser are you using?** Exact version numbers are helpful.
* **What's the name and version of the OS you're using**?
* **Which browser plugins do you have installed that could be affecting content on the site?**
